## Welcome!

This repository serves as my submissions, personal reflections and thoughts on the Full Stack Open 2020 mooc by University of Helsinki. This would also serve as my portfolio, and would constantly be updated as I learn and progress through the material.

### Directory Guide

The repository is structured such as that each part has its own branch, and within each branch is a README file which contains the details of that part. Written in the README file are my thoughts, reflections and processes on each exercise and the course as a whole. I also included snippets of code in the README, but it is still preferable to refer to the References directory and cross-check the entire code for each exercise.

The folders are also structured according to part.
