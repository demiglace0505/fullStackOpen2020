## Yahallo!

This repository serves as my submissions, personal reflections and thoughts on the Full Stack Open 2020 mooc by University of Helsinki. This would also serve as my portfolio, and would constantly be updated as I learn and progress through the material.

### Directory Guide

The repository is structured such as that each part has its own branch, and within each branch is a README file which contains the details of that part. There is also the references folder, which contain the code that I used for each exercise.

The folders are also structured according to part.
