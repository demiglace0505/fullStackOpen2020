## Yahallo!

This repository serves as my submissions for the Full Stack Open 2020 mooc by University of Helsinki. This would also serve as my portfolio, and would constantly be updated as I learn and progress through the material.

### Directory Guide

The folders are structured such that for each part of the course, each project has its own folder. Note that the Reference and Sandbox subdirectories only serves as a sandbox for experimental stuff, and thereby not to be included in checking.
